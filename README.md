# Marketplace Nexus

## Pubky Marketplace indexer

`pubky/marketplace-nexus` is the indexer behind the Pubky Shop. It is the
official [`pubky/pubky-nexus`](https://github.com/pubky/pubky-nexus) plus
**marketplace indexing**, which the shared Nexus doesn't have. It runs as a
dedicated instance beside the marketplace's transaction service.

The repo carries the full history of the earlier fork,
[`BitcoinErrorLog/pubky-nexus`](https://github.com/BitcoinErrorLog/pubky-nexus).
That fork has been frozen since 6 Oct 2026, and marketplace work happens here.
Generic fixes go upstream as their own PRs. The marketplace code is being
reduced to a thin layer on top of upstream Nexus, so this repo stops carrying
a copy of upstream code.

**Added over upstream:**

- Ingest + streams for the marketplace records defined in the
  `BitcoinErrorLog/pubky-app-specs` fork: **listings**
  (`GET /v0/stream/listings` with auction terms and reputation snippets,
  per-listing projection), **shops** (profile/policy details), and
  **drops** (`GET /v0/stream/drops` with owner and time-window bucket
  filters — documented as estimates; the transaction service stays the
  authority for live state — plus `GET /v0/drop/{owner}/{drop_id}`).
- **Review indexing with cryptographic verification at ingest**: purchase
  attestations (compact JWS) are signature-verified before a review counts
  as attested; reputation aggregates served per shop and per listing.
  Attestor *legitimacy* remains the client's trust-list policy.
- Marketplace tag aggregation endpoints for listings and shops.
- The index stays deliberately **lossy**: variants, shipping options,
  attributes, digital-lock details, and any live stock/order state are
  never indexed — clients hydrate the canonical homeserver record and the
  transaction service's projections.

**Fixes:** `setup_graph` now tolerates Neo4j's `AlreadyExists` race when
concurrent processes create the same new index (surfaced by parallel test
boots).

Deploy runbook for the dedicated instance: `docs/railway-deploy.md`.

Pubky Nexus is the central bridge connecting Pubky homeservers with [Pubky-App’s](https://github.com/pubky/pubky-app) social clients. By aggregating events from homeservers into a rich social graph, Nexus transforms decentralized interactions into a high-performance, fully featured social-media-like API. It's designed to support Social-Semantic-Graph (SSG) inference, and more.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Real-time Social Graph Aggregation**: Nexus ingests events from multiple Pubky homeservers, generating a structured social graph in real time.
- **Full-Content Indexing**: Nexus serves content directly, improving latency and user experience. Clients do not need to locate homeservers to retrieve content unless they wish to perform content attestation. We also envision a light-weight Nexus mode that merely point clients to homeserver locations using pubky uris.
- **High Performance & Scalability**: Built in Rust, Nexus is optimized for speed and efficiency, handling complex social queries across distributed systems with minimal latency.
- **Powerful Social Semantic Graph**: Nexus supports SSG-based interactions, fostering secure and trusted connections between users.
- **Graph-Enhanced Search & Recommendations**: Nexus leverages Neo4j to offer deep insights, relationships, and recommendations based on the social graph.
- **Flexible Caching Layer**: A Redis cache accelerates access to common queries and minimizes database load, ensuring a smooth user experience. Most requests can be served in less than 1 ms at constant time complexity with respect number of users.
- **Rich Observability**: Easily explore the indexed data using [Redis Insight](https://redis.io/insight/) and visualize the graph database with [Neo4j Browser](https://browser.neo4j.io/).

## 🌐 Accessing the API

> ⚠️ **Warning**: The API is currently **unstable**. We are using the `/v0` route prefix while the API undergoes active development and changes. Expect potential breaking changes as we work toward stability.

Nexus provides a REST API, accessible via Swagger UI:

- **Staging API** (latest): [https://nexus.staging.pubky.app/swagger-ui/](https://nexus.staging.pubky.app/swagger-ui/)
- **Production API** (current): [https://nexus.pubky.app/swagger-ui/](https://nexus.pubky.app/swagger-ui/)

You can explore available endpoints, test queries, and view schema definitions directly within Swagger.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Nexus is composed of several core components:

- **nexus-service**: The REST API server for handling client requests, querying databases, and returning responses to the Pubky-App frontend.
- **nexus-watcher**: The event aggregator that listens to homeserver events, translating them into social graph updates within the Nexus databases.
- **nexus-common**: A library crate containing common functionalities shared by `service` and `watcher`, including database connectors, models, and queries.
- **nexusd**: Manages the execution of Nexus components, with the capability to perform database migrations and reindexing when required

### Data Flow

![pubky-nexus-arch](docs/images/pubky-nexus-arch.png)

1. **Event Ingestion**: The watcher ingests events from Pubky homeservers and indexes them into our social graph.
2. **Indexing and Caching**: Relationships, common queries, and graph data are cached in Redis for high-speed access. Complex queries use Neo4j.
3. **API Responses**: The service server reads from these indexes to respond to client queries efficiently.

## ⚙️ Setting Up the Development Environment

To get started with Nexus, first set up the required databases: Neo4j and Redis.

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Copy the environment template and set up the Docker environment:

```bash
cd docker
cp .env-sample .env
docker compose up -d
```

3. Optionally, populate the Neo4j database with initial mock data. Follow [Running Tests](#-running-tests) section about setting up mock data.

4. Run the Nexus service:

```bash
# Run with defaults values. The config file will default from $HOME/.pubky-nexus/config.toml
cargo run -p nexusd
# Run from config file
cargo run -p nexusd -- --config-dir="custom/config/folder"
# There is also an option to run services individually
# Useful to run a database clear command before start running the watcher
# cargo run -p nexusd -- db clear
cargo run -p nexusd -- watcher
cargo run -p nexusd -- api
```

5. **Access Redis and Neo4j UIs and Swagger endpoint**:
   - Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui)
   - Redis Insight: [http://localhost:5540/0/browser](http://localhost:5540/0/browser)
     - Note: on first run, an error popup is shown and a TOS popup. After you accept the TOS, the link will work.
   - Neo4J Browser: [http://localhost:7474/browser/](http://localhost:7474/browser/)

## 📈 Observability

If you want to enable observability in Nexus, you can connect it to an OpenTelemetry exporter. Follow these steps:

1. Install Signoz locally – Follow the Signoz installation [guide](https://signoz.io/docs/install)
2. Configure the connection – In _config.toml_, uncomment the `otlp_endpoint` variable to point Nexus to the Signoz endpoint
3. Run Nexus – Start nexusd using the configured settings
4. Access the Signoz dashboard – Open http://localhost:3301 in your browser (allow some time for data to populate).

## 📦 Data Migrations

The Migration Manager is a purpose-built tool designed to simplify and standardize the process of performing data migrations in our backend system. It ensures a smooth transition during breaking changes to our data sources, such as Neo4j and Redis, by coordinating phased migrations with minimal disruption to the application. The manager tracks the status of each migration in the database, automates phase progression where possible, and provides a clear structure for developers to implement and manage migrations. This approach reduces the risk of data inconsistencies, ensures reliability during deployments, and keeps migration-related code isolated and easy to find.

### Understanding Migration Phases

The Migration Manager uses a phased approach to handle data migrations safely and systematically. Each phase serves a distinct purpose in transitioning data from the old source to the new source, ensuring consistency and minimal disruption. Here's an overview of the phases:

- **Dual Write**: During this phase, all writes to the old source are mirrored to the new source. This ensures that both sources remain synchronized during normal application operations. Developers invoke `MigrationManager::dual_write` in the application logic (preferrably in the application data layer) for this purpose. Once dual writes are stable and verified, the migration can progress to the next phase.
  **Note**: Mark a migration as ready for backfill phase using the `backfill_ready` in `config.toml`(_nexusd/src/migrations/config.toml_) by providing a comma separated list of migration ids.

- **Backfill**: In this phase, any missing or historical data in the new source is backfilled from the old source. This ensures that the new source is fully populated and consistent with the old source. The Migration Manager handles this phase automatically when the migration is progressed.

- **Cutover**: The application begins reading from the new source instead of the old source. For Redis, this often involves renaming keys (e.g., swapping the new key to the old key name). This phase ensures that the application is fully transitioned to the new source.

- **Cleanup**: The old source is no longer needed and can be safely cleaned up. This includes removing old keys in Redis or deleting data in Neo4j that is no longer required.
  Use the example at /examples/migration.rs as your guide.

### Adding a new migration

1. To create a new migration, use the migrations binary by running:

```bash
cargo run -p nexusd -- db migration new TagCountsReset
```

This will generate a new migration file in the `nexusd/src/migrations/migrations_list` directory.

2. Next, register your migration in the `import_migrations` function in `nexusd/src/migrations/mod.rs` file, which ensures it is included in the migration lifecycle.

3. Once registered, implement the required phases (dual_write, backfill, cutover, and cleanup) in the generated file `nexusd/src/migrations/migrations_list/tag_counts_reset_1739459180.rs`. Each phase serves a specific purpose in safely transitioning data between the old and new sources.

### Run the migration

After implementing your migration, run the migrations to execute pending migrations:

```bash
cargo run -p nexusd db migration run
```

The manager will automatically handle migrations in the appropriate order, progressing through phases as needed.

### Runbook: backfilling auction terms on listing rows (`ListingAuctionTermsReindex1787256279`)

Marketplace listings indexed before the index carried the auction term fields
(`auction_starts_at`, `auction_ends_at`, and the buy-now/minimum-increment
prices) serve `null` terms until re-indexed. Private reserve terms are never
indexed. This single-staged migration finds
every auction row without terms in the graph, re-reads each listing's canonical
record from its seller's homeserver (`/pub/pubky.app/marketplace/v1/listings/…`),
and re-runs the normal listing ingest — upserting the full details in Neo4j and
Redis and rescoring the listing in the auction end-time sorted set.

Operational notes:

- The migration needs outbound access to homeservers (it reads canonical
  records over the Pubky client, mainnet by default). For a local testnet
  deployment set `testnet = true` and `testnet_host` in the migration config.
- It is **idempotent**: reindexed listings gain their terms and drop out of the
  candidate query. If some listings fail (e.g. a homeserver was unreachable),
  the migration reports the count, stays in the backfill phase, and a re-run
  retries only the failed ones.
- A listing whose canonical record no longer exists on its homeserver is
  logged and left untouched; removals stay with the watcher's DEL pipeline.
- The watcher does not need to be stopped: the backfill runs the same ingest
  as a PUT event, and a concurrent seller re-publish simply wins with newer
  data.

### Runbook: scrubbing legacy listing reserves (`ListingReserveScrub1789805700`)

Older Nexus versions stored a public listing's auction reserve in Neo4j and
Redis. This single-staged, idempotent migration removes the legacy graph
property from every listing and rewrites every listing details cache entry
through the reserve-free model. Run it through the same migration command
before serving the reserve-free release.

To run it, an operator executes on a host with access to the deployment's
Neo4j and Redis (connection settings in `~/.pubky-nexus/migrations/config.toml`;
the file is created with defaults on first run):

```bash
cargo run -p nexusd -- db migration run
```

The scrub reads only Neo4j, removes `auction_reserve_price_minor` from each
listing node, and rewrites the corresponding Redis details JSON; it does not
read homeservers. The graph query removes the property from all matched rows
and captures their identifiers atomically. Before re-reading any row, the scrub
batch-deletes the exact captured `ListingDetails` JSON keys; failure aborts the
migration. It then rewrites reserve-free details for every row that still
exists. A row that disappeared is logged and counted without any later delete.
This ordering makes concurrent reserve-free re-publishes safe: one completed
before eviction can lose its cache, but the surviving graph row restores it;
one completed after eviction is never deleted by the scrub. Because Neo4j and
Redis are separate stores, a re-publish or DEL between the scrub's graph read
and cache write can still produce last-writer-wins stale details, but every
scrub-written value is reserve-free and the scrub performs no post-read delete.
The normal event pipeline or a scrub rerun reconciles that pre-existing
cross-store race. Listing stream sorted sets are untouched. Row decoding errors
and Redis write or delete failures still abort the migration. It is safe to
rerun, and an aborted run remains in the pending backfill phase for the next
run.

### Runbook: pruning listings whose record is gone from the homeserver (`db prune-stale-listings`)

A listing whose DEL event the watcher never processed stays in Neo4j and Redis
and keeps showing in the listing stream even though the seller's record is gone.
`nexusd db prune-stale-listings` finds those rows and removes them through the
watcher's own listing DEL path: the listing's tags (with each tagger's `tagged`
count, the label scores, the taggers sets, the by-tag timeline and autocomplete),
the graph node, the Redis details, and the timeline, per-seller and auction
sorted sets.

It reads connection settings from `~/.pubky-nexus/migrations/config.toml`, like
`db migration run`, and needs outbound access to the sellers' homeservers.

```bash
# 1. Dry run (default): reports the stale listings, changes nothing
cargo run -p nexusd -- db prune-stale-listings

# 2. Delete them, after checking the list from step 1
cargo run -p nexusd -- db prune-stale-listings --apply

# 3. Run the dry run again: it should report 0 gone
cargo run -p nexusd -- db prune-stale-listings
```

Safety rules:

- Only a **404 from the seller's homeserver** marks a row stale. An unresolvable
  homeserver, a rate limit, a 5xx or a timeout is counted as "could not be
  checked", the row is left alone and the command exits non-zero.
- Before each delete the record is fetched again, and a listing whose file is
  back at that point is left untouched.
- The delete of a row is recoverable. The row is recorded in the Redis set
  `Prune:StaleListings` before its delete starts and removed from it only after
  a final check of the homeserver. The delete itself is idempotent, removes the
  Redis indexes first, the tags and graph node next, and sweeps the Redis
  indexes once more (a details read in between refills the cache).
- If the seller republishes while a delete is running and the watcher indexes
  the new record before the delete finishes, the final check finds the record,
  reads it back and re-indexes the listing; the run prints "Re-indexed N
  listing(s) whose record came back". Tags the listing had before the delete
  are not restored, because the tag events are not replayed.
- If a run is interrupted (killed process, Redis or Neo4j failure), run the
  command again. It checks every listing in the graph plus every row still
  recorded in `Prune:StaleListings`, so a listing whose graph node is already
  gone is still finished, and a listing whose record came back is re-indexed.
  The dry run lists both kinds.
- More stale rows than `--max-prune` (default 50) aborts before anything is
  deleted, so a misbehaving homeserver cannot empty the index. Raise the limit
  only after reading the dry-run list.
- The run is idempotent and the watcher can keep running. Homeservers are
  checked eight at a time.
- Exit code is non-zero when any listing could not be checked or deleted; the
  summary line says how many. A re-run retries only what is still stale or
  pending.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Running tests requires setting up mock data (`docker/test-graph/mocks`) into Neo4j and Redis.

Use the `db` command to load the mock data:

```bash
# If you're using podman instead of docker, set this env variable before importing mock data
# export CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman
cargo run -p nexusd -- db mock
```

Then to run the tests:

```bash
cargo nextest run -p nexus-common --no-fail-fast

cargo nextest run -p nexus-webapi --no-fail-fast

# nexus-watcher tests need the Postgres Connection URL as env variable, adjust it as needed
# export TEST_PUBKY_CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://test_user:test_pass@localhost:5432/postgres?pubky-test=true
cargo nextest run -p nexus-watcher --no-fail-fast
```

To test specific feature(s):

```bash
cargo nextest run -p nexus-watcher files::create --no-fail-fast
```

## 🚀 Benchmarking

If you want to see the performance of the server you can run the benchmarks

```bash
# cargo bench -p nexus-webapi [--bench <endpoint>]
cargo bench -p nexus-webapi
# or if you want specific endpoint
cargo bench -p nexus-webapi --bench user
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

If tests or the development environment seem out of sync, follow the [Running Tests](#-running-tests) steps to reload the mock data.
